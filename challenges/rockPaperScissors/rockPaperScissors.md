Rock Paper Scissors

Write a program that can take in two responses for a
rock-paper-scissors game and declare who the winner is. [source](http://golf.shinh.org/p.rb?RPS+winner)

Easy mode: Given an input like "Rock Paper", output the winner ("Paper"). If they're both the same, output the move once.
Hard mode: Take in a custom move list, like in [Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock](http://www.samkass.com/theories/RPSSL.html), and judge winners the same way. You can decide the format for your input.
