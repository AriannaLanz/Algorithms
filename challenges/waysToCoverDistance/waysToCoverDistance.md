# Count the number of ways to cover distance

Given a distance â€˜dist, count total number of ways to cover the distance with 1, 2 and 3 steps.

Examples:

```javascript
f(3) // How many ways can you cover a distance of 3?
// => 4
// 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
// 1 step + 2 steps
// 2 steps + 1 step
// 3 steps

f(4)
// => 7
```
